#  Vanilla Logs

Mod to enable the TS4 vanilla logs on startup. Based on https://modthesims.info/d/606667/sims-log-enabler.html by scumbumbo.

### Cheat commands
While running these commands are available (to be entered in the cheat console):
* logs.enable .... Enable logging, the log is always appended. Restarting TS4 clears the log.
* logs.disable ... Disable logging and close all open log files.
* logs.flush ..... Write buffered logs to disk.
* logs.level n ... Change the log level to n=[0..5] (FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG or ALWAYS)

All console changes are temporarily. They are not persisted in the configuration file.

### Configuration file
On startup, it will create a configuration file with these options:
* ENABLE_LOGGING: bool = True ... Write the vanilla logs when starting TS4
* BUFFERING: int = 1 ............ Buffer and write one line. <0:default; 0:unbuffered; 1:line; 2:os_default; >2:byte_size. https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open
* FORCE_FLUSH: bool = True ...... False: Don't flush the file after every write (if buffering is set)
* LOG_LEVEL: int = 5 ........... `[0..5]` (FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG or ALWAYS)
* GROUPS: set = {} .............. {}=All. Specify individual case-sensitive groups to log, e.g. {'Zone', 'Utils'}

The file is based on the Python dict() datatype. Use 'True' or 'False' as this is not JSON.


# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.108.329, S4CL 3.5, TS4Lib 0.3.20 (2024-05).
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

All are available for free.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.

## Usage Tracking / Privacy
This mod does not send any data to tracking servers. The code is open source, not obfuscated, and can be reviewed.

Some log entries in the log file ('mod_logs' folder) may contain the local username, especially if files are not found (WARN, ERROR).
